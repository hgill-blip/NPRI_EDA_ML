        "- Carbon Monoxide (CO)\n",
        "\n",
        "Under NPRI reporting rules for combustion air releases (Part 4 substances), a facility generally must report if it emits ≥20 tonnes per year of NOₓ (as NO₂) or CO at the facility level (ECCC, 2022). In some cases, stack-level or flare-level reporting is also required, but that applies only if:\n",
        "1. the facility is already above the facility-wide threshold, and  \n",
        "2. the specific stack/flare also exceeds a more strict stack-specific threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CO, for example, there is a 10 tonne/year stack threshold along with physical criteria such as stack height and exhaust conditions (ECCC, 2022). The NPRI guide also defines the equivalent rule for NOₓ stacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important detail: in NPRI reporting, “nitrogen oxides (expressed as NO₂)” means NO and NO₂ reported as NO₂-equivalent mass. Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is not included in that number (ECCC, 2022). So “NOₓ” in this dataset is not “all nitrogen oxides of any kind,” it is a specific regulated definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Units: NPRI emissions to air are typically reported in kilograms per year. When facilities report in tonnes, 1 tonne (t) = 1,000 kilograms (kg) (ECCC, 2022).

        "\n",
        "Question we’re asking:\n",
        "> Did the introduction of federal carbon pricing in 2019 (as a national backstop price on carbon pollution) correspond to measurable changes in reported industrial emissions of NOₓ (as NO₂) and CO?\n",
        "\n",
        "We break that into two objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Descriptive analysis**  \n",
        "   Measure how reported NOₓ and CO releases to air changed after 2019.  \n",
        "   We do this in two ways:\n",
        "   - Total emissions per year (national view).\n",
        "   - Average emissions per facility per year (per-facility view).\n",
        "\n",
        "   The per-facility view matters, because totals alone can drop just because fewer facilities are reporting. If the “typical” facility is emitting less after 2019, that’s a stronger signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Predictive framing**  \n",
        "   Use those post-2019 trends to reason about what might happen next as the carbon price continues to rise.  \n",
        "   This is NOT a trained ML forecast yet. It’s a logic-based forecast:\n",
        "   - “If average NOₓ per facility in Province X has been dropping year-over-year since 2019 with no rebound, we expect that slope to continue under ongoing pricing pressure.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Important scope note:  \n",
        "The NPRI mostly captures larger, stationary industrial sources that pass reporting thresholds. It does not include every small or mobile source (like individual vehicles or small boilers). So when we talk about “emissions going down,” we are talking about large industrial facilities that report to NPRI, not Canada-wide combustion in general (ECCC, 2025).\n",

        "\n",
        "Before doing any trend analysis, we inspected and cleaned the raw data. Key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Column naming / consistency**  \n",
        "   Original columns were messy (bilingual labels, punctuation, trailing spaces like `\"Release to Air - Stack / Point  \"`).  \n",
        "   We standardized all column names to lowercase, ASCII, and snake_case (underscores).  \n",
        "   Example: `\"Release to Air - Stack / Point  \"` → `release_to_air_stack_point`,  \n",
        "   `\"Reporting_Year / Année\"` → `reporting_year_annee`.  \n",
        "   This avoids bugs when grouping or merging.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Geographic validity**  \n",
        "   Each row includes latitude and longitude. Some rows reported `0` for latitude or longitude, or coordinates that are clearly outside Canada.  \n",
        "   We flagged those as invalid and plan to replace missing/invalid coordinates using the median latitude/longitude for that province.  \n",
        "   Why? We care about comparing provinces over time (policy signal), so we preserve provincial information instead of dropping “bad location” rows entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "   We do **not** drop rows just because the coordinates are missing. Dropping those rows would bias the dataset (for example, under-counting certain industries or regions that report less precise coordinates).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Missing / placeholder values**  \n",
        "   Text fields sometimes contain `\"N/A\"`, `\"blank\"`, `\"Unknown\"`, etc. We treat those as missing.  \n",
        "   For emissions amounts, we do **not** automatically convert missing to 0. “Not reported” is not always the same as “zero emissions.” Leaving missing values as `NaN` avoids faking a drop in emissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Unit handling**  \n",
        "   NPRI air releases are often recorded in kilograms, but in our working dataset the CO and NOₓ values we care about are reported in tonnes.  \n",
        "   We keep them as tonnes and note that assumption (ECCC, 2022).  \n",
        "   This prevents silent unit mix-ups in plots and summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Duplicates**  \n",
        "   After filtering down to only CO and NOₓ, we checked for duplicate rows (same facility, same pollutant, same year).  \n",
        "   We found a small number, dropped them, and reset the index so each row is a unique facility–pollutant–year record.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Scope narrowing**  \n",
        "   After cleaning, we built our main analysis dataset by keeping **only two pollutants**:\n",
        "   - Carbon monoxide (CO)\n",
        "   - Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ, expressed as NO₂-equivalent)\n",
        "\n",
        "   We focus on these because both are directly tied to combustion. If carbon pricing is successfully pushing facilities toward cleaner combustion or reduced fossil fuel use, these two pollutants should be among the first to show a decline (ECCC, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line: after pre-cleaning, the dataset is (a) column-consistent, (b) spatially usable at the province level, and (c) tightly focused on combustion pollutants that are relevant to carbon pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Findings and Visualizations\n",
        "\n",
        "After cleaning and filtering to CO and NOₓ, we ran exploratory data analysis (EDA). We looked at four things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time trends after 2019**  \n",
        "   We calculated:\n",
        "   - Total reported CO and NOₓ released to air per year, and  \n",
        "   - Average emissions per facility per year.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The per-facility average is very important. Total emissions can fall just because fewer facilities reported. But if the *typical facility* is reporting less NOₓ or CO after 2019, that supports the idea that facility-level combustion emissions are actually going down in the carbon pricing era.\n",
        "\n",
        "   If both (a) total emissions and (b) average-per-facility emissions trend downward in the post-2019 period, that pattern is **consistent** with pricing pressure.  \n",
        "   Note: this is correlation, not proof. Other factors (new tech, process changes, fuel switching, economic slowdowns, shutdowns, etc.) can also drive declines.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Provincial differences**  \n",
        "   We grouped by province and reporting year to compare average NOₓ and CO emissions per facility across provinces.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Why this matters:  \n",
        "   Canada’s carbon pricing system has a federal backstop, but some provinces run their own approved systems. If Province A shows a sharper drop in per-facility NOₓ or CO starting in 2019 compared to Province B, that might reflect different pricing strength, compliance strategies, or parallel provincial regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Because we preserved province information (and didn’t just drop “bad coordinate” rows), we can actually make these province-to-province comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Distribution and outliers**  \n",
        "   We plotted facility-level emissions vs. reporting year for CO and NOₓ.  \n",
        "   Result: emissions are highly skewed. A few very large emitters can dominate national totals.\n",
        "\n",
        "   That means a big “downward jump” in total national NOₓ might just be one or two large facilities changing operations, not a nationwide shift.  \n",
        "   This is why we always interpret per-facility averages alongside totals. If the median or mean per facility is drifting down, that suggests broader behavioral change.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Conclusion & Next Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "We prepared a clean, policy-relevant subset of NPRI records focused on two combustion-linked air pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ, expressed as NO₂). We standardized column names and units (tonnes), validated and repaired invalid or missing coordinates using province-level rules, removed duplicates, and limited the dataset to variables required for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our EDA covered national totals and per-facility averages by year across 2000–2022, with special attention to post-2019 dynamics that align with the start of federal carbon pricing. We compared provinces to account for different policy regimes and inspected distributional skew to ensure results are not dominated by a small number of very large emitters.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also explored relationships between NPRI outcomes and external indicators preparing us for the next steps, including GDP, population, and energy consumption. These indicators help situate facility-level emissions within a broader economic and energy context. For example, GDP growth, population size, and sectoral energy intensity can shape levels of NOₓ and CO released to the atmosphere. These external sources will be merged into the NPRI panel in the next phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Merge GDP, population, and energy data to create province-year features aligned to NPRI reporting years.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Re-check missingness and outliers after the merge and finalize imputation choices documented by mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Build baseline time-series summaries and simple rule-based forecasts to extend the manual-prediction work.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document assumptions, unit conventions, and data-quality checks to support reproducibility.\n",

        "\n",
        "Our analysis focuses on whether Canada’s federal carbon pricing system (introduced in 2019) has contributed to reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and carbon monoxide (CO), two key pollutants associated with fossil fuel combustion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because pollutant releases are reported by facilities located across Canada, geographic accuracy (latitude and longitude) is critical for:\n",
        "\n",
        "Grouping and comparing facilities across provinces and regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifying spatial emission trends over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linking facility emissions to the relevant carbon pricing jurisdiction (since implementation differs by province).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, a small number of rows contained missing or invalid coordinates.\n",
        "Rather than discard those records, we performed provincial-level median imputation to maintain dataset integrity and preserve geographic representativeness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>**Methodological Rationale**\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures:\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial realism — imputed coordinates remain consistent with known industrial regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Policy relevance — spatial granularity aligns with provincial carbon pricing jurisdictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical integrity — the median minimizes distortion from extreme geographic outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data retention — facilities with missing coordinates are not excluded, preventing provincial bias in emission trend analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, provincial-level median imputation effectively balances data completeness with spatial validity, allowing the study to focus on how carbon pricing correlates with emission trends rather than coordinate precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Validation and Range Filtering\n",
        "\n",
        "All latitude and longitude values were first validated against known Canadian geographic bounds (latitude: 40°–85°, longitude: −150° to −40°).\n",
        "Invalid, zero, or non-numeric coordinates (e.g., “N/A”, “blank”) were replaced with NaN to mark them as missing.\n",
        "This range was selected based on official Canadian geographic extents (Natural Resources Canada, 2022).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Swapped Coordinate Correction\n",
        "\n",
        "In cases where latitude appeared negative and longitude positive (e.g., lat = −112, long = 54), the columns were assumed to be swapped during data entry and were corrected.\n",
        "This follows standard geographic QA practices for environmental spatial datasets, which recommend detecting and rectifying coordinate inversions prior to analysis (Esri, 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>**Why the median:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The median was chosen instead of the mean because it is less sensitive to outliers (e.g., remote northern facilities) and probably better reflects the “geographic center” of typical facility distribution.\n",

Currently each row represents a single companie's npri report for that year along with its assigned sector and corresponding GDP and population information. However, this level of granularity is not ideal for a rolling-window regression model designed to evaluate the effect of the federal carbon pricing system. Since the carbon price is applied at the provincial level and its impacts are felt at the sectoral level, it makes more sense for our dataset to reflect these broader structural units. By aggregating emissions across all facilities within eac province-sector-year, we shift the grain of our data from individual copmany reporting to the level where policy and economic/social factors operate. This allows us to model changes in total emissions more accurately, reduces noise caused by facility level changes, and ensures that each row represents a policy relevenat unit for analyzing how carbon pricing has influences emissions over time."
